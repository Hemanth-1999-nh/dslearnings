Romeo and Juliet :
A great love story or a story of fights !

People's perception about romeo and juliet was its a great love story. 
But historians would deny this perception.
They say it as a story of desires, a story of lust, a story of physical relationship
between an immature boy and girl.
These boy and girl were then prince and princess of vast empires.
Their realtionship lead to inter-kingdom fights which lead to death of 12 finest warriors.
And people yet think of it as a great love story.
History was again wrong in telling the facts.
Hence history shouldn't be blindly believed unless its proven.

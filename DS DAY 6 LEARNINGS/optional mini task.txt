"""
  Write a program to perform a basic ‘Ceaser’ encryption and decryption on text.
  This algorithm works by moving letters along by an ‘offset’. 
  If the offset is 2 then b —> d, h—>j etc.
  Try to write two functions—One called ‘encrypt’ and one called 'decrypt'. 
  Both will return a string.
  The user selects whether the wish to encrypt or decrypt.
  The user enters sentence to encrypt and the encryption key (i.e.
  How many we move the letters along—this is a smallish integer)
  The program responds with the encrypted or decrypted version

Algorithm for encryption
  Type in text
  Type in encryption key
  Display Encrypt(text, key)
  function Encrypt(text,key)
  For each letter in text
  Get its ascii code
  Add the key to the ascii code
  Turn this new ascii code back to a character
  Append character to ciphertext string
  End for
  return ciphertext
  end

Hints
  To get a single character from a string of characters just add position in brackets after string name.
  Text=“Hello”
  Text(0)=“H”
  Len(Text) or Text.length
  will give you the number of
  characters in string.
